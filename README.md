Under guidance, I have almost tried all the possible combination of qualified criteria for searching SEAMBH, but all failed. Some code used in latter project may come from this project.

--  PROJECT TERMINATED -- 

Programmed with python by Cheng Xinlun

v1 launch: Feb. 22nd, 2016

SEAMBH stands for Super-Eddington Accreting Massive Black Hole. It is possible that these black holes exist in the center of quasars. It is commonly believed that they posses the following characteristics:
    1. Strong FeII emission
    2. Low OIII 5007
    3. Lorentian-shaped Hbeta

After trying searching with all possible combination, we failed to find any distinct difference with SDSS RM12, which lead to the termination of this project.

However, the FeII template in this project is very effective in dealing with FeII emission lines fitting from 4000A - 5500A, which will be used in furture projects related to SEMBH.
